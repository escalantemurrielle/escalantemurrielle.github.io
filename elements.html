								<section>
									<p>Hello, I am m Murielle Escalante, a recent graduate with a degree in Computer Science. Throughout my academic journey, I've delved into various programming languages such as Java, Python, and C++, and complemented this with hands-on experience gained through internships and projects. The blend of theoretical knowledge and practical application has equipped me with a strong foundation in software development, algorithm design, and data analysis.</p>
							<p>During my time at university, I actively sought out opportunities to apply my learning. I engaged in internships where I honed my skills by working on real-world projects, gaining exposure to industry practices and teamwork. This exposure has not only enhanced my technical abilities but has also instilled in me a keen understanding of the collaborative nature of software development and problem-solving.</p>
							<p>My portfolio is a testament to my dedication and passion for the field. It features the projects I've undertaken, each highlighting different aspects of my skills, from software development to algorithm implementation. I am enthusiastic about the prospect of contributing to innovative tech solutions and am eager to bring my knowledge and energy to a dynamic team, contributing to and learning from a vibrant, forward-thinking environment.</p>
